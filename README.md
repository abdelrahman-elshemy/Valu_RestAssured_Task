# REST Assured Project

This project utilizes **REST Assured**, **Maven**, and **TestNG** to validate the data of API responses using assertions. **REST Assured** is a powerful Java library for testing RESTful APIs, allowing developers to write concise and expressive tests.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to perform API testing and validation of response data using **REST Assured**. By leveraging **Maven** for project management and **TestNG** for test execution, this project aims to provide a comprehensive example of API testing practices.

## Features

- Validates API response data using assertions.
- Utilizes **REST Assured** for making HTTP requests and assertions.
- Manages project dependencies and builds with **Maven**.
- Executes tests and generates reports using **TestNG**.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine.
- **Apache Maven** installed on your machine.
- IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) with **Maven** and **TestNG** support.
